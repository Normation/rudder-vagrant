=== Synopsis

This git repository contains a Vagrant (http://www.vagrantup.com) configuration, enabling
the user to launch from scratch a complete Rudder environment in a few minutes.

=== Requirements

There are two dependencies: VirtualBox and Vagrant.

The former may be installed using your favorite package management system, and the latter
using RubyGems.

See the complete installation instructions here:

* VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* Vagrant (latest is better, 1.3.5 as of November 2013): http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html

=== Usage

When you have the required dependencies, you will have to ensure that your local machine
also resolves as "server.rudder.local". This can be done by copy-pasting this small shell
script chunk in you favorite shell. You only need to do this once.

-------------------
if ! grep -q "server.rudder.local" /etc/hosts; then sudo sed -i "s/^\(192\.168\.42\.10.*\)/\1 server.rudder.local server/" /etc/hosts; fi
-------------------

Clone this repository:

----
git clone https://github.com/Normation/rudder-vagrant.git && cd rudder-vagrant
----

Then you can use the Vagrant environment at will:

* To launch a complete environment (server and node based on debian 7)

----
vagrant up server_debian node1_debian
----

NOTE: Your rudder environment is available at: http://server.rudder.local:8080/

NOTE: The node and the server are automatically set to communicate with each
other, but you will have to wait approximately 10mn before the node appears in
Rudder's web interface in the node acceptation pane.
If you are in a hurry, run a /opt/rudder/sbin/cf-agent on the node, and on the
server to make things go a bit faster.

=== Available machines

We try to provide all systems supported by Rudder with rudder-vagrant.

You can launch at the same time, one server Rudder and up to ten nodes.

Use as _vagrant up_ parameters:

* To up a server: *server_[OS_name]*
* To up a node: *node[1-10]_[OS_name]*

Systems that support both server and nodes:

* Debian 6, name used: *debian6*
* Debian 7, name used: *debian*
* Centos 6, name used: *centos*
* Ubuntu 12.04, name used: *ubuntu*
* SLES 11, name used: *sles*

Systems that support only nodes:

* Centos 5, name used: *centos5*

All informations above a are summarized in the table below:
[width="40%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|=======
| *OS*        | *Name*   | *Available machines*
| Debian6     | debian6  | Server and nodes
| Debian7     | debian   | Server and nodes
| Centos6     | centos   | Server and nodes
| Ubunu 12.04 | ubuntu   | Server and nodes
| SLES 11     | sles     | Server and nodes
| Centos5     | centos5  | Nodes only
|=======

=== Available versions

Each branch of this project allow you to create a Rudder server in a specific version.
It also adds disabled newer versions repositories, so you can upgrade easily your nodes and server by enabling them.

Branch *master* always points to stable release of Rudder, and adds latest repository. (As of Oct. 2013, stable version is 2.6.x and latest is 2.7.x)

There is also a branch for each version released: *branches/rudder/X*, based on version X, and with possible upgrades to version > X

All informations above a are summarized in the table below:
[width="40%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|=======      
| *Branch*    | *Based on*   | *Available upgrade*
| master      | stable (2.6) | latest (2.8)
| branches/rudder/2.8 | 2.8  | N/A
| branches/rudder/2.7 | 2.7  | 2.8
| branches/rudder/2.6 | 2.6  | 2.7, 2.8
| branches/rudder/2.4 | 2.4  | 2.6, 2.7, 2.8

=== Command reference for Vagrant

* Launch selectively one machine:

----
vagrant up server_debian
----

* Cleanly shutdown the VMs (issuing a "vagrant up" after that does not deploy the
VMs again but instead starts them normally)

----
vagrant halt
----

* Trash the enviroment (obliterate the VMs)

----
vagrant destroy
----

* Suspend / Resume the VMs (NOT RECOMMENDED)

----
vagrant suspend # Or "resume"
----

NOTE: This command messes up the VMs clock (I call that the DeLorean effect) and is
likely to make Rudder output odd reports if you do not have an active NTP daemon.

* Open an SSH shell connection to a machine

----
vagrant ssh server_debian
----
