# to get interesting colour effects
# Colours are one of: 
#       none, default, bold, underline, blink, reverse, concealed,
#	black, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white,
#	on_black, on_green, on_yellow, on_blue, on_magenta, on_cyan,
#       on_white, beep
# on_red means that the background (instead of foreground) is painted 
# with red etc...
