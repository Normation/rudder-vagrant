Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I suggest to directly use the subversion repository, using something like:

% cd
% svn checkout http://svn.asyd.net/svn/zsh/trunk .zsh
% ln -s .zsh/zshrc .zshrc

Warning, this will overwrite your .zshrc file if its exists.

**** REMEMBER TO UPDATE ****

Per host configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is one file configuration per host, store in ~/.zsh/rc.hosts. If
no configuration file for your current hostname, the default.zsh file is used.
So copy the default.zsh to <short hostname>.zsh, and edit it :

% cd ~/.zsh/rc.host
% cp default.zsh ${$(hostname)//.*/}.zsh

This method is very useful when your homedirectory is managed by NFS for
example.

Local configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want override somethings that are defined in my configuraiton, I strongly
recommands you to create a ~/.zsh/rc.local file (which will never be managed
by subversion). This files is read after others one.

Prompt configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The prompt is defined in ~/.zsh/rc.os files, you can defined colors in
~/.zsh/rc.host<file>

Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you use the subversion repository (as I recommand! :), it's probably a better
idea to not edit files managed by SVN, use the ~/.zsh/rc.hosts/<hostname>.zsh to
overwrite.
